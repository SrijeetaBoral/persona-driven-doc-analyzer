# 📘 Persona-Driven Document Intelligence (Round 1B)  
### Adobe India Hackathon 2025 – “Connect What Matters — For the User Who Matters”



## ✅ Overview

This project is an **intelligent document analysis system** designed to extract and prioritize the most relevant sections from a collection of PDFs, based on a given **persona** and their **job-to-be-done**.

It handles various domains such as research papers, educational material, business reports, or instructional guides — and tailors its analysis dynamically using local language models, embeddings, and rule-based scoring.

---

## 🧠 Approach

Our pipeline follows these steps:

1. **PDF Loading & Text Segmentation**  
   - Extracts all pages from PDFs using PyMuPDF (`fitz`) into structured text segments.

2. **Persona & Job Detection**  
   - Automatically detects the best-fitting persona + job pair from a predefined list using local semantic similarity scoring via `all-MiniLM-L6-v2`.

3. **Section Ranking**  
   - Ranks PDF sections (paragraphs/headings) based on semantic similarity to the job-to-be-done using cosine similarity over embeddings.

4. **Granular Sub-section Extraction**  
   - From each top-ranked section, extracts concise and relevant sub-parts with refined, human-readable text to ensure clarity and precision.

5. **Output JSON Generation**  
   - Constructs a structured output in the exact format required by the challenge, including ranked section titles, metadata, and refined sub-section texts.
